In the Beginning
----------------
| In the beginning:
| God created 0
| nothing, formless and empty
| Then God said, "let there not be nothing"
| And then there was 1
| something, at least
| God saw that 1 was good
| Then God said, "if 1 is good, then 10 is better"
| God blessed the 0 and the 1
| And God said to them, "Here are DeMorgans Laws,
| I give you dominion over them.
| Go forth and multiply"
| And God beheld this stack, and it was very good
| And on the last instruction God forked, his only begotten daemon
| And God said, "Only through my daemon, can a 0 or 1 come"
| And 10 begat 00 which begat 01 which begat 11
| which begat 011 which begat 010 which begat 110
| which begat 101 which begat 100 which begat 000
| which begat 001
| Recursively
| And God saw that the begatting, over and over
| had begotten into a mess
| Eerywhere Entropy was increasing,
| Information was less and less
| And God saw that to all things an end must come
| Then God said, "goto: In the beginning"

Is That True?
-------------
| Is that true?
| I know this one is true
| and this too is true
| It is true that is this one
| and that is this too
| If this one is that and this too is that
| then that is true.
| only when this one is this too!
| so when is that true?
| that one is that
| that will be that too
| that one was true
| but that too could be either
| is neither this one nor that
| not this too
| That was true, that too is not true
| now that that too is not true
| 
| So when will that be true?
|

That Facebook
-------------
| I don't like that many people
| That much
| To invest that much time on
| That platform
| That costs that much
| 
| 

Imagine
-------
| Close your eyes
| Picture nothing
| Try as you might, you can't
| The void, the darkness
| The phenomenological nothingness
| Can't exist
| Couldn't have existed
| It will exist
| Until it negates itself
| Because nothing can't exist
| 
| If something could exist then nothing no longer exists
| If something does exist then everything will exist
| When everything will exist then nothing will change
| When nothing can change then something has changed
